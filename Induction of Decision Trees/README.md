# ID3 Algorithm Implementation

This repository contains a Python implementation of the ID3 (Iterative Dichotomiser 3) algorithm. The models are built from scratch without relying on any machine learning libraries, showcasing the underlying principles and algorithms.

## Description

In this project, the ID3 algorithm is implemented to generate decision trees from datasets. This method creates a decision tree based on information gain, making it suitable for classification tasks.

# Logistic Regression Algorithm Implementation

This repository contains a Python implementation of the popular Logistic Regression Algorithm. The model is built from scratch without relying on any machine learning libraries.

## Description

In this project, we develop a basic Logistic Regression model, without regularization of cost computation, to fit the hypothetical dataset from Appendix A of the paper. The goal is to replicate the results and perform some of the more general analysis and reporting steps. Comments in the code are included to guide readers through the implementation and the paper, aiming to make the process clearer. Apologies for any over-commenting!

## Link to Video

I will post a link to the YouTube video describing the implementation shortly! A complete breakdown of the algorithm and findings is in the Jupyter Notebook.

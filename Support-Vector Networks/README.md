# Support-Vector Networks Algorithm Implementation

This repository contains a Python implementation of the SVM algorithm. The models are built from scratch without relying on any machine learning libraries, showcasing the underlying principles and algorithms.

## Description

In this project, I explore a basic application of the Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm for a two-group classification problem using a linear kernel. The SVM algorithm is implemented from scratch to separate features in a two-dimensional space. The model aims to find the optimal hyperplane that maximizes the margin between two classes. Through this project, I demonstrate the principles of SVM, including the use of regularization and gradient descent for training the model.
